Part 1

My two jQuery-driven interactive elements in the form include:  Three "focusout" events for
the email field and the two password fields requiring the forms to not be left empty.
To see these in action, click on the "Enter Email" text input box and then click out
with it still blank, and a message will appear.  Click on the "Enter Password" text input
box and click out with it still blank to see another one.

My site’s click effect is when you click the picture of Captain Benjamin Sisko, images of his
officers switch from hide() to show() and start slideToggle, slideUp/slideDown, and slideDown/slideUp,
and also the css toggles the text color to white and the background color to Federation blue.

My site’s hover effect is if you hover over the picture of Weyoun (the alien with blue eyes),
it will display 2 other characters below and have the even h2 tags' text color change to red and the background color
changed to black. Hover out to have the page restore itself to its previous look/behavior when the mouse rolls
off the element - note that it restores itself by sliding, so it make take a second to return to the previous look
or a few seconds if you constantly hover in and out a few times as it takes a few seconds each time you hover in
or out to return.

Two more effects of my choice are I included a couple of "keyup" events that
check to see if the passwords match and a "click" event
if the submit button is clicked before the forms are filled out.
